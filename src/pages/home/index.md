homeMainContent: "## About Me\n\n### Miami \U0001F3DD️ based ex Silicon Valley software engineer and tech advisor\n\nI'm a full-stack product engineer \U0001F468\U0001F3FF‍\U0001F52C with 10 + years of experience building software primarily on the web and mobile at scale for Silicon Valley Tech Giants (ex-LinkedIn), VC backed startups, and Open Source Projects.\n\n### Throughout my career, I've built software cross-platform:\n\n* from pre-launch to **userbases in the 100 millions** \n* Across **12** unique technology stacks \n* with **venture-backed** startup teams totaling **$700+ MM raised** from 2 person seed stage to 100s at Series D.\n* also, with the 4000+ engineering team of **LinkedIn** pre(and post) MSFT acquisition.\n\n## Most recently\n\nOne of the **first 50 employees at** [**OpenSea**](https://opensea.io/) where I built the [**foundations of social integrations**](https://twitter.com/opensea/status/1473416243688480779) with Twitter among other yet to be released social networks **for all NFT collections and accounts** on the service. I also designed and deployed the pioneering **social media metadata service backend that powers trust an safety analytics** based on imported social profiles (i.e. a users follower count and other metrics) among other projects\n\nPrior to that\n\n**Helping to build a growing 7 figure business** with Kubernetes ☸ (k8s) and crystal lang as a **founding core maintainer** of the open source [ **https://github.com/cncf/cnf-testsuite/**](https://github.com/cncf/cnf-testsuite/) **a project with over ~100 stars on github** \n\n**tl:dr?** the **suite** assesses that **k8s** apps built in the **1.74 trillion telecom \U0001F4DE\U0001F4F1☎️\U0001F4E1 industry can scale** for the **CNCF** whose members include **Google and Amazon** among other cloud giants [https://www.**cncf**.io/about/members/](https://www.cncf.io/about/members/)\n\nWhich I [**gave a talk**](https://youtu.be/n8g60VglyUw?list=PLe1-A91ZPTpAhkbyQSFbF5DdZEFhlMxEL&t=694) about at the [**2021 Crystal 1.0 Conference**](https://crystal-lang.org/conference/)\n\nhttps://www.eventbrite.com.ar/e/crystal-conference-10-launch-tickets-149153252393\n\n## Before that\n\nI dove deeply into web app dev and built **code bases from scratch to 100,000s+** lines of code \U0001F4BB on \n\n* **Frontend** (js, &lt;insert flavor of the month framework &gt;, etc.)  \n* **Ruby / Rails** or **Node.js** backends, \n* with **PostgreSQL** in general as the data store.\n\n## About the biz\n\n### I **taught myself to code in high school** and earned a B.S. in Computer Science from **Georgia Tech**.\n\nI spent my free time in college **building** this consulting biz I still operate today on the side. So I bring value from **ideation to launch and beyond** since **I've worn many hats** and empathize with other roles in a business. I've \n\n* **Sold**, previously **six figures of revenue only working part-time** as an independent and now help close **7 figure deals with a team**.\n* **built** successful **marketing campaigns for 300+ person social events** in San Francisco\n* **Written** blog posts with **10,000+** views\n* **advised** startups on product and engineering strategy. \n\n## Constantly learning\n\nI'm continually learning new things also. A few projects:\n\n* I built and polished apps that received **press coverage from 7+ internationally recognized news outlets** and were downloaded over **80,000** times in around **70+ countries** \n* an auto prioritizing todo list in Trello and a summarizer. using AWS lambda, the serverless framework, and the Trello api \n* a [hacker news](https://news.ycombinator.com/) comment notifier with node.js + hasura on k8s [**https://www.hacknotescenter.com/**](https://www.hacknotescenter.com/)\n\n## In my spare time\n\nI enjoy **mentoring** (**mentees** have gone on to have successful tech careers and **even raise Venture Capital**). \n\n## Lets brainstorm!\n\nFinally, whether or not **we work together**. I'm always a person you can **reach out to and brainstorm** on challenging technical problems."
