  ## About Me


  ### Atlanta üåÜ based ex Silicon Valley software engineer and tech advisor


  I'm a full-stack product engineer üë®üèø‚Äçüî¨ with 14 years of experience building software primarily on the web and mobile at scale for Silicon Valley Tech Giants (ex-[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/)), VC backed startups (ex-[OpenSea](https://opensea.io/)), and Open Source Projects ([cncf/cnf-testsuite](https://github.com/lfn-cnti/testsuite)).


  ### Throughout my career, I've built software cross-platform:


  * from pre-launch to **userbases in the 100 millions** 

  * Across **12+** unique technology stacks 

  * with **venture-backed** startup teams totaling **$700+ MM raised** from 2 person seed stage to 100s at Series D.

  * also, with the 4000+ engineering team of **LinkedIn** pre(and post) MSFT acquisition where we shipped the version of [Linkedin.com/jobs](https://www.linkedin.com/jobs) that you see today.


  ## Most recently


  I've been working with **BCGX** (<https://www.bcg.com/x/>) the tech build and design unit of **[BCG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Three_(management_consultancies))**. 


  **Imagine if you could hire a top team from** [**FAANG+** / MANGA / (your fav acronym)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Tech) to help overhaul your tech stack or improve your products from design to scalability. **That's this team.**


  So far I've worked on everything from 


  * **overhauling github actions pipelines for a multi-billion dollar energy company**'s mobile apps 

  * to **leading a team building a weekly sentiment analysis pipeline for a graph database of the entire energy economy**. (Which I later presented to an executive department of the federal government.)

  * Also I've helped multi-billion dollar **med-tech and healthcare** companies **build and scale critical care distributed systems** 

  * and **led an internal BCGX team to build one of the companies first multi agent Generative AI Applications** to power content generation.


  Prior to that


  I was one of the **first 50 employees at** **[OpenSea](https://opensea.io/)** where 


  * I built the **[foundations of social integrations](https://twitter.com/opensea/status/1473416243688480779)** with **Twitter, Instagram, and Discord** among other social networks **for all NFT collections and accounts** on the service.

  * I also designed and deployed the pioneering **social media metadata service backend that powers trust and safety analytics** based on imported social profiles (i.e. a users follower count and other metrics) among other projects

  ## About the biz

  I spent my free time in college **building** this consulting biz I still operate today on the side. So I bring value from **ideation to launch and beyond** since **I've worn many hats** and **empathize with other roles in a business outside of software** since I've
