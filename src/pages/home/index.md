  ## About Me


  ### Miami üèùÔ∏è based ex Silicon Valley software engineer and tech advisor


  I'm a full-stack product engineer üë®üèø‚Äçüî¨ with 14 years of experience building software primarily on the web and mobile at scale for Silicon Valley Tech Giants (ex-[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/)), VC backed startups (ex-[OpenSea](https://opensea.io/)), and Open Source Projects ([cncf/cnf-testsuite](https://github.com/cncf/cnf-testsuite/)).


  ### Throughout my career, I've built software cross-platform:


  * from pre-launch to **userbases in the 100 millions** 

  * Across **12+** unique technology stacks 

  * with **venture-backed** startup teams totaling **$700+ MM raised** from 2 person seed stage to 100s at Series D.

  * also, with the 4000+ engineering team of **LinkedIn** pre(and post) MSFT acquisition.


  ## Most recently


  One of the **first 50 employees at** **[OpenSea](https://opensea.io/)** where I built the **[foundations of social integrations](https://twitter.com/opensea/status/1473416243688480779)** with Twitter among other yet to be released social networks **for all NFT collections and accounts** on the service. I also designed and deployed the pioneering **social media metadata service backend that powers trust an safety analytics** based on imported social profiles (i.e. a users follower count and other metrics) among other projects


  Prior to that


  **Helping to build a business** with Kubernetes ‚ò∏ (k8s) and crystal lang as a **founding core maintainer** of the open source [ **https://github.com/cncf/cnf-testsuite/**](https://github.com/cncf/cnf-testsuite/) **a project with over ~100 stars on github** 


  **tl:dr?** the **suite** assesses that **k8s** apps built in the **1.74 trillion telecom üìûüì±‚òéÔ∏èüì° industry can scale** for the **CNCF** whose members include **Google and Amazon** among other cloud giants [https://www.**cncf**.io/about/members/](https://www.cncf.io/about/members/)


  Which I **[gave a talk](https://youtu.be/n8g60VglyUw?list=PLe1-A91ZPTpAhkbyQSFbF5DdZEFhlMxEL&t=694)** about at the **[2021 Crystal 1.0 Conference](https://crystal-lang.org/conference/)**

  ## Before that


  I dove deeply into web app dev and built **code bases from scratch to 100,000s+** lines of code üíª on 


  * **Frontend** (js, &lt;insert flavor of the month framework &gt;, etc.)  

  * **Ruby / Rails** or **Node.js** backends, 

  * with **PostgreSQL** in general as the data store.


  ## About the biz


  ### I **taught myself to code in high school** and earned a B.S. in Computer Science from **Georgia Tech**.


  I spent my free time in college **building** this consulting biz I still operate today on the side. So I bring value from **ideation to launch and beyond** since **I've worn many hats** and empathize with other roles in a business. I've 


  * **Sold**, previously **six figures of revenue only working part-time** as an independent and now help close **7 figure deals with a team**.

  * **built** successful **marketing campaigns for 300+ person social events** in San Francisco

  * **Written** blog posts with **10,000+** views

  * **advised** startups on product and engineering strategy. 


  ## Constantly learning


  I'm continually learning new things also. A few projects:


  * I built and polished apps that received **press coverage from 7+ internationally recognized news outlets** and were downloaded over **80,000** times in around **70+ countries** 

  * an auto prioritizing todo list in Trello and a summarizer. using AWS lambda, the serverless framework, and the Trello api 

  * a [hacker news](https://news.ycombinator.com/) comment notifier with node.js + hasura on k8s **<https://www.hacknotescenter.com/>**


  ## In my spare time


  I enjoy **mentoring** (**mentees** have gone on to have successful tech careers and **even raise Venture Capital**). 


  ## Lets brainstorm!


  Finally, whether or not **we work together**. I'm always a person you can **reach out to and brainstorm** on challenging technical problems.
